Space Engineers Server Maintenance utility
By David McDonald - Started 12/07/2014

This script is to load a SpaceEngineers save and perform maintenance & cleanup tasks such as;
 - Removal of unneeded objects, multiple classifications of "unneeded"
 - Removal of empty factions & factions that don't own anything
 - Restore asteroids that no one is near (in progress)

It requires a fair chunk of RAM at times because it has to load & parse the large SE save file. Some of those get up to 100MB.

v1.1 15/07/2014
 - Added Junk mode, removing everything without a reaction, regardless of fuel or status.
 - Considered pruning factions without a leader but you might get into strife over factions getting along without a leader,
	 suddenly having base turrets turn on friendlies. Won't do that.
 - Added function to remove all free-floating objects. Doesn't do corpses though, they are more complicated
 - Added whatif mode, like Powershell, doesn't make any changes but tells you what it'll do. Good for debugging
 - Added function to remove junk players, players that don't own anything. Also removes them from factions.
	Considered using players with the <IsDead> attribute True, but that would screw up ownership. 
	Might consider another mode that removes "dead" players and sets ownership of their stuff to "nobody".

v1.1.1 16/07/2014
 - Fixed up Player pruning. Removes player from the FactionPlayer and FactionRequests tables
 - Fixed up Faction pruning. Stopped removing factions who's members don't own anything, will only clear away empty factions now. The player pruner should make this more viable
	Also removes factions from FactionRelations & FactionRequests
	
v1.2
 - Added function to kill movement and inertia
 - Added function to soft and hard turn off assemblers and refineries
 - Discovered that Rotors are joined based on proximity, no by an ID. To avoid damage until a solution is found, no object with a stator or a rotor will be removed.
 - Modified PlayerPrune to: Owns Nothing & (Not in a faction OR IsDead). This will remove all junk dead player entries as well as player entries for those that join the server, play for 20secs then leave
 - Added function to remove NPC ships
 
v1.2.1
 - Added in "barebeacon" cleanup function for when you want to keep things with a beacon on it, regardless of power or anything else
 - Added in --ignore-joint function to ignore the restriction on removing things with joints. USE WITH CAUTION.
 
 v1.3
 - Added support for batteries
 - Refined NPC detection, now looks for DampenersEnabled == 'true'
 
 v1.3.1
 - Unicode faction & player names no longer cause exceptions
 - Added --full-clean option to do --cleanup-objects dead --cleanup-items --prune-players --prune-factions --disable-factories soft
 
 v1.3.2
 - Rewrote for Python 3, should resolve unicode issues
 - Added saving & respawning of asteroids (--save-asteroids & --respawn-asteroids)
 - Removed cleanup modes, replaced with --cleanup-unpowered, --cleanup-include-solar, --cleanup-missing-attrib and --cleanup-missing-subtype
 - Now gives an instructive message if you just double click on the utility
 - Added support for detecting Pistons as a joint
 - Added support for semi-auto batteries
 
 v1.3.3
 - Added logging
 - Added some scripts to the dist folder to make things more user-friendly
 - Added feature to try to determine a cubegrids name based on attached beacons and antennae
 - Removed counting a semi-auto battery as a valid power source as it doesn't always work. Will just stick to detecting "ProducerEnabled" and a charge level above 0
 
 v1.3.4
 - Added more logging, is now more descriptive as to why it's doing something
 - To allow for intentionally disabled ships, changed --cleanup-unpowered to just detect for fueled reactors and charged batteries, regardless if it's disabled or charging. As long as it has the potential for power, it'll be safe.
 - Changed backup naming to <save>.backup and <save>.<timestamp>.backup
 - Fixed up player pruning, was having issues detecting factionless players
 
 v1.3.5
 - Added in more Unicode handing
 - Corrected NPC removal function, was using some old Attrib finding code that an SE update broke
 
 v1.3.6
 - Adjusted XPrint calls for greater error handling
 - Fixed to handle blank / empty names for beacons & antennae
 
 v1.3.7
 - Fixed some issues with NPC detection
 - Added function to remove Refinery queues. They don't do much but as of SE 01.043, can explode into an indefinite amount of entries, causing lag and large save sizes
 - Added ship name detection with new ship naming under the Info tab
 - Updated Disable Factories to work with new SE factory node layout
 
 v1.3.8
 - Added option to turn off spotlights
